### procurement-fraud-detection

## Anomaly Detection in Public Procurement
This project develops a machine learning model to identify high-risk, potentially fraudulent contracts in a simulated government procurement system.

# Methods: 
Engineered features like cost_overrun_pct and winner_to_estimate_ratio. Trained and compared an unsupervised Isolation Forest model with a supervised Random Forest Classifier.

# Results: 
The model successfully identifies fraudulent contracts with high precision. Key risk factors include high cost overruns, single-source contracts, and a low number of bidders.

# Impact: 
This tool can be used as an early-warning system for auditors, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public fund oversight.

This project demonstrates not just your technical skill in machine learning, but also your strategic thinking in tackling a core problem within the public sector.
